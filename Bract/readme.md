#Bract

Accompanying Max patch for Magnolia.
It should be fired up and ready to receive OSC from Magnolia.
Bract requires two external objects `[jx.gain~]` && `[OSC-route]`, both are included in the root folder. Apparently the jx objects are not available anymore, or have changed names, but they are originally from [jvkr.nl](http://jvkr.nl). I downloaded them from [this Cyling74 forum thread](https://cycling74.com/forums/topic/how-can-i-create-a-slider-to-do-smooth-gains/#.VzFKw2Z9j-A). The CNMAT externals are [here](http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads) or in the package manager in Max 7.2+.
